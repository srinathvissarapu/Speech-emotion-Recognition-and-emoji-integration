# Speech-emotion-Recognition-and-emoji-integration

While video chats have become commonplace, the lack of facial expressions and body language can make effective emotional communication difficult. This project intends to bridge the communication gap by developing a system for real-time voice emotion identification, which will generate real-time visual representations (emojis) that dynamically reflect the speaker's emotions by analyzing emotional clues within spoken words.
